# Group Project Proposal
### Project Title: Demographic Disparities in Transportation in metro-Detroit
### Group Name: Motor City Motor Equity
### Group Member: Akshay Jalluri

## Introduction of Research Question
My research question is to determine the trends between transportaion access and race in certain areas within metro-Detroit. Are there certain types of demographic populations that have unequal access to the same transportation needs as other populations? Through this research analysis, we will be able to better determine trends and be able to identify which geographic areas are lagging behind in terms of transportation access and what can be done to fix it. This analysis will also help Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) and Detroit Department of Transportation (DDOT) accurately determine where additional investments must be made in order to efficinetly meet equity needs of the population.

## Why this is Important
For me personally, this topic is very intriguing and personal. I am originally from metro-Detroit, and I have gained a lot of pride in the city, especially because the 2008 recession hit the auto industry the hardest, and I was just a kid when seeing Detroit hit its rock bottom. Due the constant bad press and being the top of any list that a city strives not to be at, I have lots of hope in the city. My lifelong goal is to be a leader that can bring Detroit into the best version of itself, and with my interest in transportation, I hope to make a big difference in the transportation within the City of Detroit. That is why I am very passionate about this project, and I hope to learn a lot from the research and analysis in this project. 

For Detroiters in general, this is important because having available and convenient access to transportation is a big factor in people's lives. Families rely on transportation to access their daily needs like going to work, being able to send kids to school, going grocery shopping to feed the family, and many other needs & wants. Devleoping equitable transportation is crucial to bring opportunities to those who are currently not able to access one right now. An analysis like this will help identify these previously ignored populations and give the funding where it is needed. It will also save money for the government, where they wouldn't have to waste money on infrastructure in areas where there won't be needed.

In the past few years, Detroit has really turned things around and is headed towards a bright future. Even though it is headed the right way, there still needs to be many things done right in order to make sure the city's trajectory does not veer off-course in the future. Building a great equitable transit infrastructure is one of the many right steps that the city needs to make, especially for a city that has historically been car-centric and is currently lacking in transit infrastructure.

## Spatial Scope
The spatial scope of this project will be looking at all the cencus traccts that are considered to be within the metro-Detroit region, mainly in Wayne, Washtenaw, Oakland, and Macomb counties.

## Data Source
**2022 Demographics by Census Tract:** This dataset provides a breakdown of aggregate demographic characteristics for each area. This includes gender, age, race, and citizen/non-citizen data. We can use this data to see trends of demographics for different areas and relate it to travel behavior patterns for those areas (from Data Set 1) to find correlations between different demographic characteristics and travel behavior and give us a better idea of how racially equitable different transportation systems are, and if there are any certain groups that could possibly be left out.

**Metro-Detroit Shapefiles:** This is a shapefile of Michigan and it is broken down into the different zones that the other datasets are broken down into. This will give a better spatial representation of different trends that I am able to find, and I will be using this file to make these visualizations. This has shapefiles of all the states, but I am just choosing Michigan for now, but that is subject to change later on if I want to include other states in my study.

## Methodology for Analysis and Resulting Visualizations
I plan to visualize data of different travel behavior patterns within metro-Detroit as well as visualizing different demographic data for the same region as well. With this, I can combine the data spatially in order to find trends that match between different demographic data and the travel behavior within the particular area. I will be using the libraries of numpy, matplotlib, pyplot, pandas, geopandas, and folium .From this, our visualizations will consist of graphs of demographic data and accessibility of transit, and also a map that will represent these spatially.

## Conclusion
Some of the insights I plan to gain from this research is seeing who are the real population groups that are actually facing the transportation access challenges. Are there any groups that are talked about in the media but in reality actually left out? I can also see what kind of transportation investments are being made and if that is actually optimal in order to meet the transportation equity needs as observed for the map, or should I recommend the government to split funding in a different way to more effectively meet the equity needs. Answering these questions with data-driven accuracy is one small step closer in fullfilling my lifetime dream and this can help fix one of the big issues that is still holding Detroit back from achieving its full potential to thrive as a city. 

# Status Update
Everything is going good!
